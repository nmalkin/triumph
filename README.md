Temples & Triumphs
==================
This is a static web application that shows monuments related to the [Roman triumph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_triumph) from the first century C.E. plotted on a map of modern-day Rome.

The locations of the temples and the triumphal route come from the map on page 151 of "The Street Triumphant. The Urban Impact of Roman Imperial Parades" in: "Streets: Critical Perspectives On Public Space" by Diane Favro (1994). The map was overlaid on Google Earth satellite imagery, and the locations were transferred (manually) and saved as KML features, subsequently being converted to GeoJSON.

The application uses [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) to display the data over [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/), with tiles served by [MapQuest](http://developer.mapquest.com/web/products/open/map).
